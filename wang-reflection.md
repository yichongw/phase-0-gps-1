##I was a little bit with switching between different branches.
##Git, GitHub, and branches were clarified during this GPS.
##I asked questions on if we can work on different branches at the same time, the answer is no.
##I'm still having a bit of trouble on deleting branches. Didn't get the chance to ask, but I'll research on my own or message the TA in slack.
##This GPS session is very helpful, and it's great to have a TA watch over you. I like it a lot.
